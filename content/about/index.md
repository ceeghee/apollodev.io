5 years ago(September 24, 2014) I wrote my first hello world console application with the C# programming language using a HP 655 Laptop, it was an amazing feeling and I couldn't bring my self to stop thinking about all the ideas and console apps I could build.

I started coding basic console arithmetic programs, student grade calculator, multiplication table... Every single idea I could think of I wanted to bring it to life!. But my C# knowledge was mainly limited to writing console applications that can accept inputs i.e using console.readline(), process it and display an output, this limited the ideas I could think of and I knew if I wanted to do more, I needed to learn more.

My curiosity and excitement was enough fuel to push me to learn more, I didn't care how hard learning more would be or how long it would take me, all I wanted was to learn enough to be able to developed the ideas I have. I made use of video tutorials mostly in learning and practicing, the major tutorial that helped me a lot was Bob Tabor's C# course. He started from the very basic then to the advanced stuffs, he did a good job in explaining the pillars of C# and major OOP concepts.

Couple of weeks later, I lost interest in console programs and I started to look for more exciting and challenging aspects to play with. I never cared about how challenging the new aspect would be, I was resilient and always ready to hit em heads on. Of course my resilience and curiosity helped my debugging skills to some extent but eventually wasn't enough, sometimes I had to re-learn the core concepts, go through my codes again, sometimes call on stackoverflow and his brothers and most times I just had to sleep on it.

For the sake of brevity, Having C# as my first programming language and a CS background gave me a stronger foundation in software engineering. Today I am a Full Stack Software Developer with more than 5 years experience in Software Development, I mostly build and work on Web Apps and Decentralized Apps, 

My tech stacks :

 for Front End Development

* Angular
* Vuejs

 for Back End Development

* Nodejs
* PHP

for Blockchain Development

* Solidity
* Blockstackjs


I am a big fan of typescript and Web3.0 üöÄ

I created this blog to write technical articles on Frontend development, Backend development and blockchain development üê±‚Äçüë§ and my general experience as a software developer.
