	"content": "5 years ago(September 24, 2014) I wrote my first hello world console application with the C# programming language using a HP 655 Laptop, it was an amazing feeling and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring my self to stop thinking about all the ideas and console apps I could build.\nI started coding basic console arithmetic programs, student grade calculator, multiplication table\u0026hellip; Every single idea I could think of I wanted to bring it to life!. But my C# knowledge was mainly limited to writing console applications that can accept inputs i.e using console.readline(), process it and display an output, this limited the ideas I could think of and I knew if I wanted to do more, I needed to learn more.\nMy curiosity and excitement was enough fuel to push me to learn more, I didn\u0026rsquo;t care how hard learning more would be or how long it would take me, all I wanted was to learn enough to be able to developed the ideas I have. I made use of video tutorials mostly in learning and practicing, the major tutorial that helped me a lot was Bob Tabor\u0026rsquo;s C# course. He started from the very basic then to the advanced stuffs, he did a good job in explaining the pillars of C# and major OOP concepts.\nCouple of weeks later, I lost interest in console programs and I started to look for more exciting and challenging aspects to play with. I never cared about how challenging the new aspect would be, I was resilient and always ready to hit em heads on. Of course my resilience and curiosity helped my debugging skills to some extent but eventually wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, sometimes I had to re-learn the core concepts, go through my codes again, sometimes call on stackoverflow and his brothers and most times I just had to sleep on it.\nFor the sake of brevity, Having C# as my first programming language and a CS background gave me a stronger foundation in software engineering. Today I am a Full Stack Software Developer with more than 5 years experience in Software Development, I mostly build and work on Web Apps and Decentralized Apps,\nMy tech stacks :\nfor Front End Development\n Angular Vuejs  for Back End Development\n Nodejs PHP  for Blockchain Development\n Solidity Blockstackjs  I am a big fan of typescript and Web3.0 üöÄ\nI created this blog to write technical articles on Frontend development, Backend development and blockchain development üê±‚Äçüë§ and my general experience as a software developer.\n"
